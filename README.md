# Cat/Dog Image Classification in R and Python

This repo is a comparison of using keras in R and python for image classification.  The comparison will be using the pretrained imagenet VGG19 model that comes shipped with keras.

The current [R](keras_vgg19_cat_dog.R) and [python](keras_vgg19_cat_dog.py) scripts are likely in their final state.

### TODO: Flesh out the Rmd file with commentary to be posted as a blog at [adamspannbauer.github.io/](https://adamspannbauer.github.io/)
